# zkPass Eco-Grants

Welcome to the **zkPass Eco-Grants** repository, where we host a series of Request for Proposals (RFPs) designed to enhance and expand the zkPass ecosystem. Our goal is to engage the developer community in building innovative solutions, tools, and integrations that will strengthen zkPass's position as a leading privacy-preserving oracle protocol.

## About zkPass

zkPass is oracle protocol that enables private web data to be verifiable. Built on top of zkTLS, composed of 3P-TLS and Hybrid ZK technologies, zkPass provides tools and applications for secure, verifiable data sharing with privacy and integrity assurances from any HTTPS website without requiring OAuth APIs.

zkPass allows users to selectively prove various types of data, such as legal identity, financial records, healthcare information, social interactions, gaming data, real-world assets, work experience, education, and skill certifications. These zero-knowledge proof computations are performed locally and securely, ensuring that sensitive personal data is not leaked or uploaded to third parties. They can be used for AI, DePIN, DID, lending, and other financial and non-financial applications.

This repository is part of our initiative to support the zkPass ecosystem through grants, hackathons, and bounties that incentivize developers to contribute to the protocol's growth.
